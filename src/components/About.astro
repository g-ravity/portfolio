        <p>Hi there!</p>
        <p>
          I've been captivated by computers for as long as I can remember. What began as a childhood
          curiosity turned into a lifelong passion that has shaped my personal and professional
          journey.
        </p>
        <div style="display: flex; align-items: center">
          <div>
            <p>
              During my B.Tech in Information Technology, I discovered my love for art and graphic
              design. I started experimenting with Photoshop and Illustrator, and gradually I picked
              up skills that helped me see creativity and technology as two sides of the same coin.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my third year, I dived headfirst into the tech world with my first internship,
              where I worked on designing the mobile app for a grocery store. This app allowed users
              to upload handwritten grocery lists, connecting them with local vendors who delivered
              everything to their doorstep. It was during this project that I found my true calling
              — software development. Determined to grow, I dove into Udemy courses, learning
              everything I could to bring ideas to life through code.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div style="margin-left: 15px">
            <img src="/coffee-cup.png" alt="Coffee" class="coffee" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Since then, my journey has been one of exploration and growth—sometimes sprinting ahead,
          sometimes pausing to recharge, but always moving forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of tech, I'm a coffee aficionado, brewing my way through endless cups while
          exploring spirituality and the profound works of authors like Camus and Dostoevsky. I've
          recently developed an obsession with board games—playing, discovering, and even creating
          free, accessible online multiplayer versions for others to enjoy. I also have a deep love
          for rock music (especially Pink Floyd) and thriller movies with great plot twists. When
          I'm not working on the next big thing, you can most likely spot me with a cup of coffee,
          curating the perfect rock playlist and doom-scrolling Instagram for heart-melting antics
          of cats and dogs. Or, you just might find me wearing a graphic t-shirt of my favorite
          music artists or TV shows, playing the Wikipedia game, and getting happily lost in a sea
          of knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Life is a mix of curiosity, creativity, and coffee for me—and I wouldn't have it any other
          way.
